# Event Instructions
Read on if you have registered for participation in one of our Hands-On Blockchain event. It is very important that you come prepared for the workshop. 

# What does it mean to be prepared?
* You MUST get your own machine (PC/Mac/Linux - all good)
* Minimum Recommended: 8GB RAM, 50GB Disk space, Decent CPU
* You MUST have administrative rights on the machine
* You MUST be able to connect to public wi-fi 
* You MUST install/setup various software that will be needed for workshop
* You MUST have basic knowledge/understanding of programming

If you do not meet the above requirements, we suggest that you un-register and plan for a future event as you would not benefit from the workshop.

# What if I face issues?

To raise and track issues we use GitHub Issues. Simply click on issues and add .... folks are looking at these issues and will do their best to help you out. If the issue you are facing cannot be solved due to challenges on your machine, you may have to arrange an alternative.

We suggest that you work on setting up your machines as soon as possible to have enough time to get all issues (if any) addressed.
